## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I finally learned how to use CSS grids effectively, instead of just flexbox. I learned how to resize and reposition each element in the grid as well. I have also realized the value of the 'container' element  because it makes everything more predictable.

Another thing I learned is how to add a background image inside of tailwind css and resize/reposition the image. I did this with the quotation mark.


### Continued development

One thing I noticed is that the default shadows in tailwind CSS do not look the same as the design. Next thing I want to learn is how to modify the shadows to make them look more accurate to the design.


### Useful resources

Tailwind docs and various google searches.
